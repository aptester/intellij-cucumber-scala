intellij-cucumber-scala 0.3.3
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danielwegener/intellij-cucumber-scala.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/danielwegener/intellij-cucumber-scala)

Enables Reference tracking of glue code when using cucumber-scala DSL.

#Features

- [x] Navigate from feature step to step definition
- [ ] Find usages of step definitions in feature files
- [ ] Wizard that creates step definitions for a step in a feature file


#Development

1. `git clone git@github.com:danielwegener/intellij-cucumber-scala.git`
2. `sbt updateIdea` will download the idea sdk to the SDK folder and all required plugins
3. Import the project as sbt project into IDEA.

To debug set

`export IDE_JVM_ARGS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=4000,suspend=n"`

Now you can build this plugin with `mvn -Didea.home=PATH_TO_IDEA clean install` or use a IDEA plugin run configuration to debug it.

> IntelliJ Plugin Development is too hard :/ Please provide a public (maybe non-oss, non-free) repo for Idea artifacts. Or maybe a sbt plugin.

To start an IDE with the plugin installed in the example project just run `sbt "runIdea example"` (_todo: does not work yet_)
